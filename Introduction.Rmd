The "Effervescent Experiment" was conducted by dissolving two different brands of 
cold medicine tablets at three different, equally spaced water temperatures using
a complete block design. We will fit several different models to determine the one
that best fits the data and hope to discover the effects, if any, of temperature
and brand on dissolving time.
